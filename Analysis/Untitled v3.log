Cause  : For slide line elements :
              - A grid point referenced on a secondary slide line was initially positioned slightly 
              below the primary line contact boundary.
              - The grid point was automatically repositioned to the primary line contact boundary. 
              For contact surface elements :
              - A grid point referenced on a secondary contact surface was initially positioned 
              slightly below the primary surface contact boundary.
              - The grid point was automatically repositioned to the primary surface contact 
              boundary.
Action : No action is required normally.The secondary node of a surface contact element is sometimes
              generated below the primary contact boundary by the pre-processor. This is more of a 
              problem for curved surfaces especially when the mesh is coarse. While the actual 
              amount of penetration is usually within the geometric tolerance of the pre-processor, 
              the resulting stresses would be significant if the grid point was not repositioned.

Cause  : For slide line elements :
              - A grid point referenced on a secondary slide line was initially positioned well 
              below the primary line contact boundary.
              - This usually indicates that the y-axis of the slide line primary segment is pointing
              away from one or more secondary grid points. For contact surface elements :

              pointing away from one or more secondary grid points. The nodal ordering of the 
              primary slide line defines the element y-axis, which must point toward the secondary 
              region.
Action : For slide line elements :
              - Check that the slide line plane vector specified on the BCONP entry is oriented 
              correctly.
              - Try changing the penetration type on the BCONP entry to unsymmetrical.
              - Check the ordering of the primary slide line grid points and regenerate if 
              necessary. For contact surface elements :

              - The grid point was automatically repositioned to the primary surface contact 
              boundary.
Action : No action is required normally.The secondary node of a surface contact element is sometimes
              generated below the primary contact boundary by the pre-processor. This is more of a 
              problem for curved surfaces especially when the mesh is coarse. While the actual 
              amount of penetration is usually within the geometric tolerance of the pre-processor, 
              the resulting stresses would be significant if the grid point was not repositioned.

Cause  : For slide line elements :
              - A grid point referenced on a secondary slide line was initially positioned slightly 
              below the primary line contact boundary.
